OEE Assistant
  
The OEE Assistant is a Streamlit-based chatbot that provides insights into Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) for packaging devices in biscuit manufacturing. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with ChromaDB and the Groq LLaMA 3 70B model to deliver detailed OEE metrics, insights, and recommendations.
Overview
The OEE Assistant helps manufacturing engineers analyze equipment performance by allowing them to filter data by Device ID, Location, and Month-Year. It processes data from an Excel file, stores embeddings in ChromaDB, and generates AI-driven responses with actionable insights.

Features

üñ•Ô∏è Interactive Filters: Select Device ID, Location, and Month-Year to query specific OEE data.
üìã Dynamic Query Generation: Auto-generates queries (e.g., "Show me the OEE for device Device2 at Plant2 in Apr-2025").
ü§ñ AI-Powered Responses: Leverages Groq LLaMA 3 70B for detailed OEE summaries, insights, and recommendations.
‚úÖ Data Validation: Warns if no data exists for selected filters.
üìÑ Context & Metadata: Displays the context and metadata used for responses, with mismatch warnings.

üìÇ File Structure


app.py: Main Streamlit application script.
Rag_Emebddings/embeddings.py: Functions for loading data, creating documents, and setting up ChromaDB.
Rag_Emebddings/queryvdb.py: Functions for extracting metadata filters and searching similar documents.
synthetic_oee_data_complete.xlsx: Sample dataset for OEE calculations.

Notes

Typo Fix: The directory Rag_Emebddings should be renamed to Rag_Embeddings for clarity. Update import paths in app.py and queryvdb.py accordingly.
Data: Ensure synthetic_oee_data_complete.xlsx contains valid data for your filters.
Performance: Query processing may take a few seconds due to embedding generation and LLM inference.
